1) Your overall application's concept

We want a make a personality quiz app that matches you up with a character from a movie, tv show, etc. Similar to buzzfeed quizzes, for example, "What Star Wars character are you?". We want to create logic that matches you with a character based on how you answer the questions. We want to add multiply quizzes to give users many options to cater to different interests. We want to add user authenitication so users can track their characters and personality quiz answers.


2) Your motivation for this project (what problem is this solving)

The idea for this project is designed around a fun concept so that users can connect to their favoite characters and have a good time doing it. Our idea in a lot of ways is similar to the friend finder homework, so we will be referencing that code as a boiler plate for our project in terms of the logic for our question algorithm.
